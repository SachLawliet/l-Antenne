            <h2>The Rich History of Coffee</h2>
            <p>Coffee's origins date back to the 9th century when a humble goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats dancing with energy after eating berries from a certain tree. Curious, Kaldi tried the berries himself, and soon he felt a surge of energy, much like an antenna drawing in signals from the universe!</p>

            </div>
            <p>From that moment, coffee spread like a radio signal across the globe. By the 15th century, coffeehouses known as "qahveh khaneh" emerged in the Middle East. These coffeehouses became hubs of conversation, politics, and culture, transmitting ideas like an antenna broadcasting signals far and wide.</p>
